            To verify the build SHA256 during the action, click the build link, go-to "Create Release", open the Echo build sha256 step and read the sha256.
            You can download the build artifacts, generate a SHA256 checksum and compare it with the below binary.
            Build artifacts ARE NOT automatically the same as release assets since release assets can be modified afterwards.
            These are nightly builds of YimMenu, they are provided for testing purposes only:
            - Test if your build environment produces a broken YimMenu.dll
            - Test if source code is out of date and no longer compatible with the current version of GTA V
            If you wish to use this menu as-is you are on your own, no warranty is provided.
